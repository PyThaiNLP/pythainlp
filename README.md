PyThaiNLP is a Python package for text processing and linguistic analysis, similar to [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) with focus on Thai language.

PyThaiNLP เป็นไลบารีภาษาไพทอนสำหรับประมวลผลภาษาธรรมชาติ โดยเน้นภาษาไทย [ดูรายละเอียดภาษาไทยได้ที่ README_TH.MD](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/blob/dev/README_TH.md)

>We are conducting a 2-minute survey to know more about your experience using the library and your expectations regarding what the library should be able to do. Take part in [this survey](https://forms.gle/aLdSHnvkNuK5CFyt9).

| Version | Description | Status |
|:------:|:--:|:------:|
| [2.2.6](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/releases) | Stable | [Change Log](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/issues/330) |
| [`dev`](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/tree/dev) | Release Candidate for 2.3  | [Change Log](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/issues/445) |

Please follow our [PyThaiNLP Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pythainlp/) for more updates.


## Getting Started with PyThaiNLP

We provide [PyThaiNLP Get Started Tutorial](https://www.thainlp.org/pythainlp/tutorials/notebooks/pythainlp_get_started.html) for exploring features in PyThaiNLP; We also have tutorials for specific tasks. Please visit [our tutorial page](https://www.thainlp.org/pythainlp/tutorials).

Latest document is available at [https://thainlp.org/pythainlp/docs/2.2/](https://thainlp.org/pythainlp/docs/2.2/).

We try to make the package easy to use as much as possible; therefore, some additional data (like word lists and language models) may get automatically download during runtime. PyThaiNLP caches additional data under the directory `~/pythainlp-data` by default, but the user can change the value by specifying the environment variable `PYTHAINLP_DATA_DIR`. See corpus catalog at [PyThaiNLP/pythainlp-corpus](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp-corpus).


## Capabilities

PyThaiNLP provides standard NLP functions for Thai, for example part-of-speech tagging, linguistic unit segmentation (syllable, word, or sentence). Some of these functions are also available via command-line interface.

<details>
  <summary>List of Features</summary>

- Convenient character and word classes, like Thai consonants (`pythainlp.thai_consonants`), vowels (`pythainlp.thai_vowels`), digits (`pythainlp.thai_digits`), and stop words (`pythainlp.corpus.thai_stopwords`) -- comparable to constants like `string.letters`, `string.digits`, and `string.punctuation`
- Thai linguistic unit segmentation/tokenization, including sentence (`sent_tokenize`), word (`word_tokenize`), and subword segmentations based on Thai Character Cluster (`subword_tokenize`)
- Thai part-of-speech tagging (`pos_tag`)
- Thai spelling suggestion and correction (`spell` and `correct`)
- Thai transliteration (`transliterate`)
- Thai soundex (`soundex`) with three engines (`lk82`, `udom83`, `metasound`)
- Thai collation (sort by dictionary order) (`collate`)
- Read out number to Thai words (`bahttext`, `num_to_thaiword`)
- Thai datetime formatting (`thai_strftime`)
- Thai-English keyboard misswitched fix (`eng_to_thai`, `thai_to_eng`)
- Command-line interface for basic functions, like tokenization and pos tagging (run `thainlp` in your shell)
</details>

Please see [our tutorials](https://www.thainlp.org/pythainlp/tutorials) on how to apply these functions to machine-learning problems.


## Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade pythainlp
```

This will install the latest stable release of PyThaiNLP.
PyThaiNLP uses pip as its package manager and PyPI as its main distribution channel, see [https://pypi.org/project/pythainlp/](https://pypi.org/project/pythainlp/)

Install different releases:

- Stable release: `pip install --upgrade pythainlp`
- Pre-release (near ready): `pip install --upgrade --pre pythainlp`
- Development (likely to break things): `pip install https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/archive/dev.zip`

### Installation Options

Some functionalities, like Thai WordNet, may require extra packages. To install those requirements, specify a set of                                                                                                                                                                                         `[name]` immediately after `pythainlp`:

```sh
pip install pythainlp[extra1,extra2,...]
```

<details>
  <summary>List of possible `extras`</summary>

-  `full` (install everything)
-  `attacut` (to support attacut, a fast and accurate tokenizer)
-  `benchmarks` (for [word tokenization benchmarking](tokenization-benchmark.md))
-  `icu` (for ICU, International Components for Unicode, support in transliteration and tokenization)
-  `ipa` (for IPA, International Phonetic Alphabet, support in transliteration)
-  `ml` (to support ULMFiT models for classification)
-  `thai2fit` (for Thai word vector)
-  `thai2rom` (for machine-learnt romanization)
-  `wordnet` (for Thai WordNet API)
</details>

For dependency details, look at `extras` variable in [`setup.py`](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/blob/dev/setup.py).


## Command-Line Interface

Some of PyThaiNLP functionalities can be used at command line, using `thainlp` command.

For example, displaying a catalog of datasets:
```sh
thainlp data catalog
```

Showing how to use:
```sh
thainlp help
```


## Python 2 Users

- PyThaiNLP 2 supports Python 3.6+. Some functions may work with older version of Python 3, but it is not well-tested and will not be supported. See [1.7 -> 2.0 change log](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/issues/118).
  - [Upgrading from 1.7](https://thainlp.org/pythainlp/docs/2.0/notes/pythainlp-1_7-2_0.html)
  - [Upgrade ThaiNER from 1.7](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp/wiki/Upgrade-ThaiNER-from-PyThaiNLP-1.7-to-PyThaiNLP-2.0)
- Python 2.7 users can use PyThaiNLP 1.6
