pythainlp.augment
=================

Introduction
------------

The `pythainlp.augment` module is a powerful toolset for text augmentation in the Thai language. Text augmentation is a process that enriches and diversifies textual data by generating alternative versions of the original text. This module is a valuable resource for improving the quality and variety of Thai language data for NLP tasks.

TextAugment Class
-----------------

The central component of the `pythainlp.augment` module is the `TextAugment` class. This class provides various text augmentation techniques and functions to enhance the diversity of your text data. It offers the following methods:

.. autoclass:: pythainlp.augment.TextAugment

WordNetAug Class
----------------

The `WordNetAug` class is designed to perform text augmentation using WordNet, a lexical database for English. This class enables you to augment Thai text using English synonyms, offering a unique approach to text diversification. The following methods are available within this class:

.. autoclass:: pythainlp.augment.WordNetAug

Word2VecAug, Thai2fitAug, LTW2VAug Classes
------------------------------------------

The `pythainlp.augment.word2vec` package contains multiple classes for text augmentation using Word2Vec models. These classes include `Word2VecAug`, `Thai2fitAug`, and `LTW2VAug`. Each of these classes allows you to use Word2Vec embeddings to generate text variations. Explore the methods provided by these classes to understand their capabilities.
