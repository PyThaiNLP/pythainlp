.. currentmodule:: pythainlp.word_vector

pythainlp.word_vector
=======================
The :class:`word_vector` contains functions that makes use of a pre-trained vector public data.
The `pythainlp.word_vector` module is a valuable resource for working with pre-trained word vectors. These word vectors are trained on large corpora and can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as word similarity, document similarity, and more.

Dependencies
------------
Installation of :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`gensim` is required.

Before using this module, you need to ensure that the `numpy` and `gensim` libraries are installed in your environment. These libraries are essential for loading and working with the pre-trained word vectors.

Modules
-------
.. autofunction:: doesnt_match
   :noindex:

   The `doesnt_match` function is designed to identify the word that does not match a set of words in terms of semantic similarity. It is useful for tasks like word sense disambiguation.

.. autofunction:: get_model
   :noindex:

   The `get_model` function allows you to load a pre-trained word vector model, which can then be used for various word vector operations. This function serves as the entry point for accessing pre-trained word vectors.

.. autofunction:: most_similar_cosmul
   :noindex:

   The `most_similar_cosmul` function finds words that are most similar to a given word in terms of cosine similarity. This function is useful for word analogy tasks and word similarity measurement.

.. autofunction:: sentence_vectorizer
   :noindex:

   The `sentence_vectorizer` function takes a sentence as input and returns a vector representation of the entire sentence based on word vectors. This is valuable for document similarity and text classification tasks.

.. autofunction:: similarity
   :noindex:

   The `similarity` function calculates the cosine similarity between two words based on their word vectors. It helps in measuring the semantic similarity between words.

.. autoclass:: WordVector
   :members:

   The `WordVector` class encapsulates word vector operations and functions. It provides a convenient interface for loading models, finding word similarities, and generating sentence vectors.
