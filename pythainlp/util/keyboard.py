    Calculate Euclidean distance between two Thai characters
    according to their location on a Thai keyboard layout.

    A modified TIS 820-2531 standard keyboard layout, which is developed
    from Kedmanee layout and is the most commonly used Thai keyboard layout,
    is used in distance calculation.

    The modified TIS 820-2531 is TIS 820-2531 with few key extensions
    proposed in TIS 820-2536 draft. See Figure 4, notice grey keys, in
    https://www.nectec.or.th/it-standards/keyboard_layout/thai-key.html

    Noted that the latest TIS 820-2538 has slight changes in layout from
    TIS 820-2531. See Figure 2, notice the Thai Baht sign and ฅ-ฃ pair, in
    https://www.nectec.or.th/it-standards/std820/std820.html
    Since TIS 820-2538 is not widely adopted by keyboard manufacturer,
    this function uses the de facto standard modified TIS 820-2531 instead.
